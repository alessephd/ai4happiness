## Overview
Happiness is the ultimate goal of life. In an era of rapidly advancing technology, it is crucial that we align these innovations with the purpose of enhancing human well-being and the health of our planet. **ai4happiness** is a project dedicated to encouraging individuals and organizations to prioritize happiness as a core objective of AI development.
